This is a VIRPIL config for a VPC CDT-VMAX Throttle + RIGHT VPC CDT-AEROMAX joystick combination.
Based on Subliminal Virpil VMAX Throttle + Aeromax-R Enhanced Star Citizen Bindings located on:

After testing these I noticed:
for Joystick Gremlim:
 -I didn't liked the NAV/SCM overlay on Button 21 and the AUX overlay on Button 22 of the Throttle as much as the Missile overlay mode on Button 3 on the AEROMAX.
 -I've kept the Missile overlay to keep the flip trigger switching between Missile mode and gun mode. 
 -I've removed the NAV/SCM overlay from these buttons to prevent mode switching.
For Star Citizen
